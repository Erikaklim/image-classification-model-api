# Image Classification Model API

- The API allows to choose an image from File Explorer in .jpg format and classifies it to one of three classes: car, drink, flower while also displaying the probability of the image being in one of these classes.
- The model used was created using Tensorflow and was pre-trained on images from Open Images.
