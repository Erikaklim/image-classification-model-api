# Image Classification Model API

- The API allows to choose an image from File Explorer in .jpg format. It classifies it to one of three classes: car, drink, flower and displays the probability of the image being in one of these classes.
- The model used was created using TensorFlow and was pre-trained on images from OpenImages.
